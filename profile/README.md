## Hi there 👋

we are some data scientists around Basel intested in some networking and exchange.  

Monthly, on the first Wednesday each month, we sit together in [Unternehmen Mitte](https://mitte.ch/), Gerbergasse 30, 4001 Basel.
These informal chats are open to all interested; contributions very welcome!

Here on github we have a place to collect git repositories and our webpage https://baseldatascience.github.io.
Further we have a linkedIn group https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12870553/ for announcements and quick communication.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
